# UNDb - The UNDT Sample Database

The UNDT Sample Database, or UNDb, is a tool developed for the UNDT Group in collaboration with the [Solid Mechanics Research Group (SMRG)](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/engineering/research/solids/). It is hosted by the [Research Data Storage Facility (RDSF)](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/acrc/research-data-storage-facility/) and is accessible from a Microsoft Access client saved on the [Sharepoint](https://uob.sharepoint.com/:f:/r/teams/grp-UNDTGroup/Shared%20Documents/UNDb). It contains data relating to every sample we have stored in the lab, including material, defect types, some experimental data, etc.

The person currently responsible for maintaining the database is [Paul Wilcox](mailto:p.wilcox@bristol.ac.uk).

## How to get started

The UNDb uses Microsoft Access to store and access the sample database. Usually Access comes pre-installed on University of Bristol managed PCs, however if you need to install it on your device, navigate to the [Microsoft Office Account page](https://portal.office.com/account) (logging in using your UoB details) and install it from there.

### Map the UNDT RDSF folder as a network location

These instructions can also be found on the [RDSF website](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/acrc/research-data-storage-facility/how-to-access-the-rdsf/). You will need to make sure that you have been added to the project by the data steward: for the UNDT project, this is [Paul Wilcox](mailto:p.wilcox@bristol.ac.uk), and make sure that you have the [VPN](https://www.bris.ac.uk/it-services/advice/homeusers/uobonly/uobvpn/howto/) installed and running if you are not on campus.

From Windows 10, navigate to `This PC`, and select `Map network drive` on the `Computer` tab.

Map the folder `\\rdsfcifs.acrc.bris.ac.uk\Ultrasonic_array_data` to an unused drive, and if prompted for a username use the format `uob\<your-uob-username>`.

### Synchronise the UNDT Sharepoint to your own device using OneDrive

Make sure that you have the Sharepoint documents folder synchronised to your personal OneDrive account. To do this, navigate to the group's [Documents](https://uob.sharepoint.com/teams/grp-UNDTGroup/Shared%20Documents/Forms/AllItems.aspx) folder and click `Sync`

<img align="center" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/undt-group-handbook/undt-handbook-v1.0/main/book/template/resources/undb/Sync.png">

Navigate to the synchronised folder. Typically, this will be located at `C:\Users\<your username>\University of Bristol\grp-UNDT Group - Documents`, and open the folder `UNDb`. Open the file `UNDb_Client.accdb`, or make a shortcut to this location to access it more conveniently.

Note that you must always access the database from this file on the Sharepoint rather than making a copy of it to your own files. This is because many of the lists used to suggest field entries are saved within the client rather than the database: any change or addition you make will only save to the file you use.

### Enable content

The database makes use of macros behind the scenes, and by default Microsoft will block access to them. To enable macros, open the UNDb Client and close the login screen, but do not close the Microsoft Access window. Navigate to `File > Options > Trust Center > Trust Center Settings > Trusted Locations`, and click on `Add new location...`. In the window which pops up, enter the location of the folder where the UNDb Client is located (e.g. `C:\Users\<your username>\University of Bristol\grp-UNDT Group - Documents\UNDb`). Click `OK` to save the location, close Microsoft Access and reopen the client. You may see a yellow warning banner in Microsoft Access, in which case click `Enable Content`, reopen the client again and you will be able to log in.

### Make sure you have a UNDb login

The login needed to access the UNDb will not be the same as your UoB account. If you have not yet received a login, please email [Matt](mailto:m.chandler@bristol.ac.uk) to get one.

When you launch the client for the first time, you will have to enable content before you will be able to access the database. Close the login screen, and within the blank Microsoft Access program, click `Enable content` on the banner. Close Access and reopen the client file: you should now be able to log in.
